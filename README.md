My Portfolio website where I apply all that I am learing to improve its design and the functionality.

This website is built using HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript.

This website is currently a reflection of all the knowledge and experience I am gaining in the field of web developement and will continue to improve and evolve along side me.
This is my playground for implementing all the skills I am acquiring so as to see the real world results of my work.
